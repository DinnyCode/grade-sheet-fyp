# Grade Sheet (Final Year Project)
This is a 4th year software development project that aims to create a web app for students of SETU to be able to store and track results with visualisations.

The app is developed with *React* and *Vite*.

## To install and run
After cloning this repo on to your machine, you will have to install **npm** which can be done via entering the following in your terminal from within the directory of this project:

```npm install```

Now that **npm** is installed we can run the app and this can be done by first navigating to the React project directory by entering:

```cd grade-sheet-app```

From here you can run the app by 
entering the following:

```npm run dev```

The terminal will then output a host for where the web app can be located.
